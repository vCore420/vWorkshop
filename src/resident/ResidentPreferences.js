/**
 * ResidentPreferences
 * ----------------------
 * "Residents should begin forming preferences... favourite places,
 * favourite weather, favourite times of day, favourite music, favourite
 * activities... weighted choices are preferred [over rigid rules]." Four
 * plain `{key: count}` bags (see `AffinityTracker.js`), bumped a little at
 * a time by `ResidentController.js` as the resident actually goes about
 * its ordinary idle life — arriving somewhere, idling through whatever
 * weather happens to be active, noticing the time of day, noticing music
 * playing nearby. Nothing here is configured directly; a "favourite" is
 * whatever's actually accumulated the most real time, which is what makes
 * this "quiet familiarity" rather than a settings field the player fills
 * in on Bubble's behalf.
 *
 * `favourite(dimension)` intentionally returns `null` below `MIN_SAMPLES`
 * — a preference only becomes real once there's actually enough behind
 * it to call a pattern, not from the very first sample.
